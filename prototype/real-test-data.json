Topics have a pseudo-hierarchical relationship. A connection from Topic A to Topic B means that Topic A is a prerequisite for Topic B. All connections are directed. If the two topics go hand-in-hand, there may be both a directed connection from Topic A to Topic B and a directed connection from Topic B to Topic A.",
